                    Excel Add-in Library: QL_Containers
========================================================================

AppWizard has created an Excel add-in DLL for you.

Although your add-in is a Dynamic Link Library (or DLL), it has the 
special suffix XLL.  When you build QL_Containers.xll, it will become 
available as an add-in library for Microsoft Excel. 

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your QL_Containers XLL.

QL_Containers.vcproj
    This project file is compatible with the Visual Studio.NET development
    environment.

QL_Containers.sln
    This Visual Studio.NET solution file contains the new project.

QL_Containers.cpp
    This file is the main DLL source file that contains the definition of
    your DLL class, CQL_ContainersApp.

QL_Containers.h
    This file is the main header file for the XLL.  It includes your 
    resource header file.

QL_Containers.rc
    This file is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It initially contains only version information.

resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

QL_Containers.help.xml
    This file is a skeleton help file. You can add your own help text and
    pages here. It contains commented out suggestions for the various
    help elements.

QL_Containers.def
    This file contains the linker definition of the XLL and a list of 
    exported functions. You should not need to make any changes to this file.
